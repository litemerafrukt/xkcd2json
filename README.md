# xkcd2json
Script that scrapes random xkcd comics and creates a json file with base64 encoded images.

I did this script just to have some json to work on for a college course. Do what you want with it, just remember to be nice to the xkcd server :)

Please reade more about how you might use the work from xkcd on: xkcd.com.

Thank you, Randall Munroe for, your funny comics!
